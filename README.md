# üî§ Wordle.copy

A galactic twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with React. Two players take turns in a space-themed interface with subtle animations and clean styling. Simple, nostalgic, and just a little out of this world.

## ‚ú® Technologies

- React  
- JavaScript  
- HTML & CSS  
- Framer Motion 
- Axios 


## üöÄ Features

- Flip animation for letter tiles 
- Shake animation for invalid guesses
- Color feedback for correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters
- Win detection and reset functionality  
- Game statistics: win rate, current streak, and games played


## üå† The Process

I wanted to recreate the addictive Wordle experience while practicing React and animations. I started with the core game logic, handling guesses, checking validity with a dictionary API, and determining win/loss conditions. Then I added smooth tile flip and bounce animations using Framer Motion to give the game a more interactive feel. Styling and layout were designed to keep the interface clean and responsive. Building this project helped me improve my skills in React, state management, and UI animations.
